# Configuration

This system is intended to be deployable by simply starting the Docker containers. However, there is some one-time configuration required, through a `.env` file which should be placed into the project root (alongside the `docker-compose-prod.yml` file).

?> You can copy the `.env.example` file into a new `.env` file, and then edit the defaults, to make configuration easier.

## General

##### `BASE_URL`

Example: `https://example.com`.

This is the base URL that the system is deployed on.

##### `REDIS_HOST`

Example: `redis`.

This is the hostname of the Redis server. When deploying in production, the Docker internal network allows you to connect to containers using their container name as the hostname.

Therefore, in production, this should usually be `redis`. In development, this should usually be `localhost` (as Redis is in Docker but the Next.js app is on your host).

## Email

To configure email, you need SMTP credentials for a mail server.

You can use transactional email providers like [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/), [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/), [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/), etc. Many of these have a free tier allowing a certain number of emails per month for free. Most of the below configuration options will be provided to you by your email provider.

The [development Docker Compose](https://github.com/shu8/cap-editor/tree/main/docker-compose.yml) configuration includes [Mailhog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog), a dummy SMTP server that catches all outgoing emails and presents them in a user-friendly UI for ease in development.

##### `EMAIL_SERVER_HOST`

Example (production): `smtp.mailgun.org`

Example (development with Mailhog): `localhost`

##### `EMAIL_SERVER_PORT`

Example: `1025`

##### `EMAIL_SERVER_USER`

Example: `username`

##### `EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD`

Example: `password`

##### `EMAIL_FROM`

Example: `cap-editor@example.com`

## Security

##### `TLS_DIRECTORY`

Example: `/tls`

This is the path to the directory in which the private key for the TLS certificate used by the system is stored in.

Note that when using the [production Docker Compose](https://github.com/shu8/cap-editor/tree/main/docker-compose-prod.yml) configuration, the TLS certificate is managed by Caddy, which is then read-only mounted to the host to the `./docker-volumes/caddy/data` directory. This host directory is then also read-only mounted within the Next.js container at the path `/tls`, so that the two containers can share the private key.

##### `PRIVATE_KEY_FILENAME`

Example: `example.com.key`

This is the filename of the private key for the TLS certificate used by the system.

##### `WEBAUTHN_RELYING_PARTY_NAME`

Example: `CAP Editor`

This should represent the name of the application. If it is a specific deployment of the CAP Editor, this should be included.

##### `WEBAUTHN_RELYING_PARTY_ID`

Example: `example.com`

This should be the domain name that the system is deployed on.

##### `WEBAUTHN_ORIGIN`

Example: `https://example.com`

This should be the full origin URL (inc. protocol, host, port) that the system is deployed on.

Note, in development this should include the port e.g., `http://localhost:3000`.

## Other

##### `WHAT_NOW_API_KEY`

Example: `qV3lFYVWUZGjsZNEx6kIXT5P9LbpKj3X`

This should be an API key generated by the [WhatNow Service](https://whatnow.preparecenter.org/).

##### `IFRC_AA_VERIFIER_EMAIL`

Example: `alerting-authority-verifier@ifrc.org`

This should be an email address which receives verification requests when users attempt to register with the system as an "Other" Alerting Authority. This contact should have the capability and authorisation to verify whether the requesting user is part of an Alerting Authority that is not already within the WMO Register of Alerting Authorities.

For more details on this process, see [Alerting Authorities](./alerting-authorities.md).
