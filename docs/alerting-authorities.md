# Alerting Authorities (AAs)

## Registering

There are two ways to onboard users from Alerting Authorities (AAs) into this system:

1. Users from AAs stored in the [WMO Register of Alerting Authorities](https://alertingauthority.wmo.int/) can choose their AA, and an email is sent to the `author` email address stored in the Register to request approval.

   The approver also assigns [the roles](./security.md) for the user.

2. Users from AAs that are not represented in the Register can choose to register as an 'Other' AA, and an email is sent to a central IFRC contact to request approval.

   The approver must assign [the roles](./security.md) for the user, and provide a name for the AA.

   Ideally, AAs should be added to the WMO Register of Alerting Authorities where possible, to reduce the administrative burden on the IFRC.

## Multiple AAs

A user can be part of multiple AAs. In this case, there is a dropdown menu in the UI to switch which AA to use when viewing and creating alerts.

Alerts are always created under a specific AA.
