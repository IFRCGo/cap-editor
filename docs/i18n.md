# Internationalisation (i18n)

This platform's user interface is fully internationalised (using [Lingui](https://lingui.dev/)) enabling users of different langauges to use the platform.

Translations must be manually added and the platform must be re-deployed on any change to the strings.

Translations are stored in the [`locales`](../locales/) directory in the repository.

## Switching language in the UI

There is a language switcher at the bottom of every page in the UI showing all currently supported languages. Clicking a language here will update the UI with the desired language.

## Adding a new language to the interface

To support a new language, the following changes must be done:

1. Update the [`next.config.js`](../next.config.js) file to append to the `i18n.locales` array the [UTS Locale Identifier](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-59/tr35.html#Identifiers) of the new language
2. Update the [`.linguirc`](../.linguirc) file to append the `locales` array with the same language identifier
3. Run `pnpm i18n:extract` to extract the messages from the source code and create the respective message catalogs under the [`locales`](../locales/) directory.
4. Manually translate the strings added to the new catalog
5. Run `pnpm i18n:compile` to compile the translations so they can be used in the frontend.

Language catalogs are stored in [`./locales/[lang]`](./locales/) in the [PO format](https://localizely.com/po-file/) (see also [the Lingui docs on the PO file format](https://lingui.dev/ref/catalog-formats#po-file-recommended)). These translations can be edited manually in a simple text editor (e.g., Notepad, TextEdit, VS Code) or specialised software can be used, such as https://translation.io/lingui (commercial online UI) or https://poedit.net/ (free [open-source](https://github.com/vslavik/poedit) desktop software).

Strings in the source code are written in English (UK) and must be wrapped in the `<Trans></Trans>` component from `@lingui/macro` package, or wrapped with the `t` macro from the same package.
