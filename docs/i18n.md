# Internationalisation (i18n)

This platform's user interface is fully internationalised (using [Lingui](https://lingui.dev/)) enabling users of different langauges to use the platform.

Translations must be manually added and the platform must be re-deployed on any change to the strings.

Translations are stored in the [`locales`](https://github.com/shu8/cap-editor/tree/main/locales/) directory in the repository.

## Switching language in the UI

There is a language switcher at the bottom of every page in the UI showing all currently supported languages. Clicking a language here will update the UI with the desired language.

## Adding a new language to the interface

To support a new language, the following changes must be done:

1. Update the [`next.config.js`](https://github.com/shu8/cap-editor/tree/main/next.config.js) file to append the [UTS Locale Identifier](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-59/tr35.html#Identifiers) of the new language to the `i18n.locales` array
2. Update the [`.linguirc`](https://github.com/shu8/cap-editor/tree/main/.linguirc) file to append the same language identifier to the `locales` array
3. Run `pnpm i18n:extract` to extract the messages from the source code and create the respective message catalogs under the [`locales`](https://github.com/shu8/cap-editor/tree/main/locales/) directory.
4. Manually translate the strings added to the new catalog
5. Run `pnpm i18n:compile` to compile the translations so they can be used in the frontend.

Language catalogs are stored in [`./locales/[lang]`](./locales/) in the [PO format](https://localizely.com/po-file/) (see also [the Lingui docs on the PO file format](https://lingui.dev/ref/catalog-formats#po-file-recommended)). These translations can be edited manually in a simple text editor (e.g., Notepad, TextEdit, VS Code) or specialised software can be used, such as https://translation.io/lingui (commercial online UI) or https://poedit.net/ (free [open-source](https://github.com/vslavik/poedit) desktop software).

Strings in the source code are written in English (UK) and must be wrapped in the `<Trans></Trans>` component from `@lingui/macro` package, or wrapped with the `t` macro from the same package.

## Using Google Translate (+Google Sheets) to perform translations

It is possible to use Google Translate to perform translations via Google Sheets. You can use the [`po-csv`](https://github.com/marek-saji/po-csv) library to convert the PO files to and from CSV files to import/export from Google Sheets:

1. Convert the PO file to CSV

   ```bash
   pnpm pocsv src/locales/LOCALE/messages.po > untranslated.csv
   ```

2. Create a new [Google Sheet](https://sheets.new)

3. Upload the CSV or paste it into the Sheet.
   Note: when pasting CSV into Google Sheets, it often adds everything as a single column.

   To split these into their correct columns, select the new `A` column, click the `Data` menu item, and choose the `Split text to columns` option.

4. In the right-most column (`msgstr[0]`), for the first string (row `2`), type in `=GOOGLETRANSLATE(CELL, "en", "TO")`, replacing `CELL` with the cell number of the first string (e.g., `B2`) and `TO` with the language code of the language you want to translate to (e.g., `fr` for French)

5. Fill-down this new cell for all the rows, to translate all strings

6. Export the Google Sheet back to CSV: `File` > `Download` > `Comma-separated-values (.csv)`

7. Convert the CSV file back to PO:

   ```bash
   pnpm pocsv src/locales/LOCALE/messages.po NEWFILE.csv > src/locales/LOCALE/messages.po
   ```

8. Compile the new strings
   ```bash
   pnpm i18n:compile
   ```

!> Google Translate might not be 100% accurate when performing automatic translations with no context, therefore it is recommended to only use this method to create an initial set of translations that are then verified/updated manually by someone who knows the language in question.
