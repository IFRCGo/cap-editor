# Future Work

- [ ] Allow users to upload their own polygon/circle coordinates (e.g., paste in, or upload from a file) in the Editor UI
- [ ] Use a generic email address for AAs in the Alert XML `sender` & `contact` fields and Feed XML `author` field (rather than the WMO Register of AA's `author` email address)
- [ ] Allow users to define their own risk/severity matrix
- [ ] Enable realtime collaboration with multiple users when editing Alerts (via e.g., WebSocket)
