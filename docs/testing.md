# Testing

This system has various types of tests.

## API

API tests are stored in [`tests/api`](../tests/api) using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

To run API tests, run `pnpm test:api`. This also outputs the overall coverage.

## Frontend

The CAP Editor component is the core component tested in the frontend due to its complexities and size.
